This page provides an overview of how to use code snippets effectively within our documentation.

## What are Code Snippets?

Code snippets are reusable blocks of code that can be easily inserted into your documentation. They help to illustrate concepts and provide practical examples for users.

## Creating a Code Snippet

To create a code snippet, use the following syntax:

```mdx
```tsx
// Your code here
```
```

## Using Code Snippets

To use a code snippet, simply reference it by its ID:

```mdx
import { MySnippet } from '@/components/snippets';

<MySnippet />
```

## Best Practices

- Keep snippets short and focused on a single concept.
- Include comments to explain complex logic.
- Use descriptive names for your snippets.
